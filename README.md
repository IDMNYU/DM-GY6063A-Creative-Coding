# Creative Coding Grad Spring 2015
Repository for Creative Coding (DM-GY 6063), Polytechnic School of Engineering, NYU. Spring, 2015.  Taught by Kevin Siwoff.

Welcome to DM-GY 6063 Creative Coding!  This repo contains assignments and code samples for the class.

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no prior programming experience. Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking, to think concurrently and modularly. By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for event-driven, object-oriented, graphical user interfaces.
