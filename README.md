# IDM Program Objectives

Students will:

* Develop   **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities in art and design.

* Develop   **technical skills** to realize their ideas.

* Develop   **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

* Gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

* Develop   **collaboration skills** to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

# Course Prerequisites

This class assumes a high degree of computer literacy, but not a high degree of programming ability. We will be learning computer programing in a platform-generic way, however all examples will be demonstrated in Javascript using the library p5.js (p5js.org).  Having previous coding experience in Javascript, Java, C++, or Python is a plus, but not necessarily a must.

# Course Description

This course is a graduate-level, introductory creative programming course, appropriate for students with no prior programming experience. Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, and scalable engineering, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. 

In Creative Coding, students are trained to go beyond sequential problem solving and to use the computer as a creative medium for art, games, and graphic design.  This course will introduce you to a variety of concepts in programming, and how they can be applied creatively to work in a variety of media, such as 2D graphics, animation, image and video processing. A strong focus will be on creating interactive experiences for the web. By the end of this course, students will be empowered to read and write javascript for creative applications, as well as walk away with a midterm and final project.

Some of the programming environments we will work with include:

### Core:

* P5.js: [http://p5js.org](http://p5js.org/)

### Also:

* ffmpeg:[https://www.ffmpeg.org/](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

* Imagemagick:[http://www.imagemagick.org](http://www.imagemagick.org)

# Course Objectives

Students in this course will:

* Understand the basics of creative coding in Javascript (p5.js).
* Apply their understanding of digital media to software.
* Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented and functional framework.
* Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.


# Course Structure

This course will be comprised of 13 weekly classes and 1 final project. Additionally, there will be small weekly homework assignments, which we will go over and build upon in class. Homework assignments will often be supplemented by reading unless otherwise noted.

# Course requirements

Course requirements include small weekly projects (studies), a project proposal, and a final project & full critique presented to the class. The grading breakdown is as follows:

* Attendance and participation (25%). More than three unexcused absences will result in a decreased letter grade.

* Weekly homework studies (submit 10) (30%).  

* IDM coursework documentation blog on Tumblr (20%). See documentation section for more info on blog requirements.

* Final project. This project can be an interactive tool, a data visualization/sonification, or any other approved proposal. Your project must use p5.js.  All final projects will be collected and put together as an "interactive book" (25%).
